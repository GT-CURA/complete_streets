# Evaluation of Transit Accessibility using GTFS and OSMnx

## 📍 Objective
This repository provides tools to compute transit accessibility scores along road network segments using GTFS feeds and OSMnx pedestrian networks.

Outputs include an interactive Folium map and structured CSV/GeoJSON files at the link level.

### Input
- A GeoJSON file of road segments links (EPSG:4326) along with:

- One or more GTFS`.zip` files
- A GeoJSON file of road segment points
- A GeoJSON file of road segments
- (Optional) Amenity score file (`all_scores.json`) to enrich bus stop facility scoring

### Process
1. Load and merge GTFS feeds into unified stop, route, and trip tables.  
2. Download pedestrian networks and generate walk isochrones using OSMnx.  
3. Compute the significance level of each bus stop referring to a multi-factor model (E/S/F/Q).  
4. Interpolate analysis points along road links and aggregate accessibility via spatial joins.  
5. Export results as interactive HTML maps, CSV summaries, and GeoJSON layers.

### Output
- Interactive map (HTML)
- CSV file with road segment-level transit accessibility scores  
- GeoJSON files with road segment-level transit accessibility scores

## 🚗 Quick Guide

### 1. Environment Setup

#### Option A — `venv` + pip

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1    # Windows

pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

> If installation of geospatial packages fails, use Conda instead.

#### Option B — Conda (Recommended)

```bash
conda create -n gtfs python=3.11 -y
conda activate gtfs

conda install -c conda-forge geopandas pyproj rtree -y
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Input Data

Your project directory should contain:

```
data/
├─ gtfs/                  
│  └─ gtfs.zip            # One or more GTFS .zip files (can be various names)
├─ amenities/
│  └─ all_scores.json     # Optional amenity score dictionary
├─ output/                # Output folder
└─ LINE_EPSG4326.geojson  # Road network (EPSG:4326)
```

1. Add the road network file:
   `data/LINE_EPSG4326.geojson`
2. Place one or more GTFS ZIP files in:
   `data/gtfs/`
3. (Optional) Add amenity data in:
   `data/amenities/all_scores.json`

If no amenity data is provided, the pipeline still executes without evaluating quality score.

#### 2-1. What Is GTFS & How to Get It

GTFS is a standardized data format that provides all essential public transit information, such as stops, routes, schedules, and trips, in a consistent structure so that transit systems can be easily analyzed.  

Sources for GTFS feeds:

* Search online: `"Seoul GTFS"`, `"NYC GTFS"`, `"London GTFS"`
* Mobility Database:
  [https://mobilitydatabase.org/](https://mobilitydatabase.org/)

Download `.zip` files and place them in `data/gtfs/`.

### 3. Run the Pipeline

From the project root:

```bash
python -m scripts.run_pipeline
```

All results will be written into the `data/output/` directory.

<br>
<br>

## 🧩 Notes
* Links with no intersecting stops receive a score of 0.
* Full functionality is preserved even without amenity data.
* Multiple GTFS feeds are merged automatically.

<br>

## Workflow

1. Load GTFS feeds and unify stops/trips/routes.
2. Define a study boundary with a 750 m buffer around road link midpoints.
3. Select bus and rail stops intersecting the study boundary.
4. Build OSMnx pedestrian networks and generate walkable catchments:
   * 700 m for all modes
   * 100 m for rail (for bus–rail connectivity)
5. Compute stop significance using:
   * `E`: route diversity
   * `S`: connectivity
   * `F`: service frequency
   * `Q`: amenities
6. Interpolate road links at 10 m spacing.
7. Join interpolated points with stop isochrones and compute mean significance per point.
8. Aggregate scores to each road link to produce final accessibility scores.

## 🔎 Descriptions

This section describes the full scoring framework applied in the pipeline.

### 1. Study Area Definition

* Compute midpoints of road centerlines.
* Apply a 750 m buffer to form the analysis boundary.
* Select all bus/rail stops intersecting the boundary.

### 2. Walkable Catchments (Isochrones)

Generated in `network.py` using OSMnx:

* 700 m isochrones: all transit modes
* 100 m isochrones: rail modes (for multimodal connectivity)

These polygons are used to identify which stops influence which locations.

### 3. Stop Significance (E/S/F/Q)

Overall model:

```
significance = E × S × F + Q
```

#### E — Route Diversity

```
factor_e = 0.5 + 0.5 * min(E, 3)
```

#### S — Connectivity

**Bus stops:**

```
factor_s_bus = 1 + 0.5 * min(k, 2)
```

`k` = number of rail routes within 3 km.

**Rail stops:**

```
factor_s_rail = 1 + 0.5 * min(S_r, 2)
```

`S_r` = number of bus stops inside a 100 m rail catchment.

#### F — Service Frequency

Peak hours: 07–09, 16–19 (6 hours total)

```
< 2 → 1.00
< 3 → 1.25
< 4 → 1.50
≤ 6 → 1.75
> 6 → 2.00
```

#### Q — Stop Facilities

**Bus:**

```
shelter_index = 2.0 if shelter else 1.0
amenities_index: ≤1→1.0, 2–3→1.5, ≥4→2.0
factor_q_bus = (shelter_index × amenities_index) / 2
```

If no amenity data → `factor_q_bus = 0`.

**Rail:**

```
2.5 (if amenity data exists)
0.5 (if missing)
```

#### Combined

```
significance_bus  = E × S_bus  × F + Q_bus
significance_rail = E × S_rail × F + Q_rail
```

### 4. Road Point Interpolation

Road segments are sampled every 10 m to form analysis points.

### 5. Point-Level Aggregation

For each interpolated point:

```
sig_sum_per_point  = Σ significance of intersecting stops
stops_count        = number of intersecting stops
sig_mean_per_point = sig_sum_per_point / stops_count  (or 0)
```

### 6. Link-Level Scoring

For each road link:

```
Score = sig_mean_mean × log((stops_computecount / points_count) + 1)
```

Separate scores for bus and rail are maintained.

### 7. Combined & Scaled Score

```
Transit_attribute = Score_Bus + Score_Rail
Transit_score     = clip(Transit_attribute, 0, 22) / 22 × 12.6
```

### 8. Final Outputs

Saved under `data/output/`:
* Interactive map:
  `Transit_Attributes_Map.html`
* GeoJSON:
  `Transit_Accessibility_SCORE.geojson`

Geometries are processed in local UTM and exported as EPSG:4326 for mapping.
